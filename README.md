If we click on Read more we can actually view our blog and great thing about these article is if we click edit you can 
see they are actually written using markdown so we can chanage this markdown to have anything we want let's just say we 
wanted to add a smaller title in here we could just say pound pound small title and click save our smaller title after
a bigger title so our markdownis automatically being converted to HTML we also have the ability to create a new article 
type in some stuff here and you see it shows up and even the path to our articles take them to account the title of the article instead of having some ugly ID in the route so we have all these intresting stuff baked into our the system even including delete button.
